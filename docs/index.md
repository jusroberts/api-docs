# Official Pardot API Documentation

Welcome! All up-to-date documentation of Pardot's official API is housed here. A few things of note:

* If you have a question about the API, feel free to [open a ticket](https://pardot.desk.com/) with our Support team.
* To report an inconsistency in the documentation, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Pardot/api-docs/issues). [Pull requests](https://github.com/Pardot/api-docs/pulls) are welcome as well!
* If you've written your own library or wrapper for Pardot's API, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Pardot/api-docs/pulls) updating the `index.md` file with a link to your repository, and we'll be glad to consider linking it up.

## Using the API

The Pardot API allows your application to access current data within Pardot. Through the API, several common operations can be performed on Pardot objects. Operations include:

*   `create` -- Creates a new object with the specified parameters.
*   `read` -- Retrieves information about the specified object.
*   `query` -- Retrieves objects that match specified criteria.
*   `update` -- Updates elements of an existing object.
*   `upsert` -- Updates elements of an existing object if it exists.  If the object does not exist, one is created using the supplied parameters.

Developers must authenticate with the API before issuing requests.  Refer to the [Authentication](#authentication) section for details about this procedure.

Some considerations must be taken while performing requests. When performing `update` requests, only the fields specified in the request are updated, and all others are left unchanged. If a required field is cleared during an `update`, the request will be declined.

The Pardot API handles a variety of requests for many of the
objects available through the Pardot user interface. Most requests
to the API use the following standardized format. All requests must
use either HTTP GET or POST. Although GET requests are secure due
to the use of SSL, we recommend using POST, with sensitive or
lengthy parameter values being part of the POST message body.
Developers are responsible for issuing requests with the following
components:

```
POST: https://pi.pardot.com/api/<object>/version/3/do/<operator>/<identifier_field>/<identifier>
message body: api_key=<your_api_key>&user_key=<your_user_key>&<parameters_for_request>

GET: https://pi.pardot.com/api/<object>/version/3/do/<operator>/<identifier_field>/<identifier>?api_key=<your_api_key>&user_key=<your_user_key>&<parameters_for_request>
```

| **Parameter** | **Required**   | **Description**                                        |
| ------------- | :------------: | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `object`       | X              | The object type to be returned by the API request                |
| `operator`    | X              | The operation to be performed on the specified object type                    |
| `identifier_field`    | X              | The field to be used as the identifier for the specified object  |
| `identifier`       | X              | The identifier for the specified object(s)              |
| `your_api_key`    | X              | The API key that was obtained during [Authentication](#authentication)                   |
| `your_user_key`    | X              | The user key that was used during [Authentication](#authentication)  |
| `format`    |               | The API data format. Either xml or json (xml is default)                   |
| `parameters_for_request`    |               | Parameters specific to your request; See individual methods for details |

The ordering of parameters is arbitrary. Parameters are passed using conventional HTML parameter syntax, with `'?'` indicating the start of the parameter string (for GET requests only) and `'&'` as the separator between parameters. With the exception of `<format>` and `<parameters_for_request>`, all components are required. Data returned from the API is formatted using JSON or XML 1.0 with UTF-8 character encoding. Keep in mind that some characters in the response may be encoded as HTML entities, requiring client-side decoding. Also, keep in mind that all parameters specified in an API request MUST be URL-encoded before they are submitted.

In general, the API will return XML or JSON containing a current version of the target object's data. However, unsuccessful requests will return a short response containing an error code and message. See [Error Codes &amp; Messages](kb/api-version-3/error-codes-messages) for error descriptions and suggested remedies.

## Version 3 and Version 4 differences

In order to accommodate a new feature related to prospects, we have created a new version of our APIs - version 4. We are now allowing multiple prospects to share an email address on some Pardot accounts. Eventually this will be available for all Pardot accounts. If your account has this feature active now, then you MUST use version 4. Everyone else can continue using version 3. Version 4 may use slightly different input syntax where prospects are involved, and may return multiple prospects where version 3 returned one. Please check out the appropriate version's documentation for more exact usage details. 

If your account uses v4, then upon login to the APIs, a data tag will be returned containing a 4. If your account requires version 3, you will not see this tag.

## Changing the API Response Format

The Pardot API supports several output formats, each of which returns different levels of detail in the XML or JSON response. Output formats are defined by specifying the `output` request parameter. Supported output formats include:

*   `full` -- Returns all supported data for the Pardot object and all objects associated with it.
*   `simple` -- Returns all supported data for the data for the Pardot object.
*   `mobile` -- Returns an abbreviated version of the object data. This output format is ideal for mobile applications.

If the output request parameter is not defined, the output format defaults to `full`. See the XML Response Format sections for each object for details about the formats.

## Authentication

A few prerequisites must be met to successfully authenticate a
connection to the API.

1.  All requests to the Pardot API must be made via SSL encrypted
connection.
2.  Authentication requests must use HTTP POST.
3.  Obtain the `email`, `password`, and `user_key` (available in Pardot under **{your email address} > Settings** in the API User Key row) for the Pardot user account that will be submitting API requests. If you need assistance in acquiring your user key, contact your Pardot support representative.

With these requirements met, an API key must be acquired. Both User and API keys are unique to individual users. API keys are valid for 60 minutes. In contrast, user keys are valid indefinitely. To authenticate, issue the following request (having replaced the values denoted by `<carets>` with values for your account):

```
POST: https://pi.pardot.com/api/login/version/3
message body: email=<email>&password=<password>&user_key=<user_key>
```

| **Parameter** | **Required**   | **Description**                                        |
| ------------- | :------------: | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `email`       | X              | The email address of your user account                 |
| `password`    | X              | The password of your user account                      |
| `user_key`    | X              | The 32-bit hexadecimal user key for your user account  |

If authentication was successful, a 32-character hexadecimal API
key will be returned in the following format:

```
<rsp stat="ok" version="1.0">
    <api_key>5a1698a233e73d7c8ccd60d775fbc68a</api_key>
</rsp>
```

Otherwise, the response will contain the following:

```
<rsp stat="fail" version="1.0">
    <err code="15">Login failed</err>
</rsp>
```

Subsequent authentication requests will return either the current valid API key or a newly generated API key if the previous one had expired.

## API Console

You can explore Pardot's API in the [API Console](http://www.pardot.com/api/). Please note that we're in the process of adding new methods.

## Sample Code

Here's an example of calling the Pardot API using a simple PHP function and the cURL library.

Note: we strongly recommend **against** using PHP's `file_get_contents` function to call the Pardot API, since it makes error handling extremely cumbersome.

```
/**
 * Call the Pardot API and get the raw XML response back
 *
 * @param string $url the full Pardot API URL to call, e.g. "https://pi.pardot.com/api/prospect/version/3/do/query"
 * @param array $data the data to send to the API - make sure to include your api_key and user_key for authentication
 * @param string $method the HTTP method, one of "GET", "POST", "DELETE"
 * @return string the raw XML response from the Pardot API
 * @throws Exception if we were unable to contact the Pardot API or something went wrong
 */
function callPardotApi($url, $data, $method = 'GET')
{
    // build out the full url, with the query string attached.
    $queryString = http_build_query($data, null, '&');
    if (strpos($url, '?') !== false) {
        $url = $url . '&' . $queryString;
    } else {
        $url = $url . '?' . $queryString;
    }

    $curl_handle = curl_init($url);

    // wait 5 seconds to connect to the Pardot API, and 30
    // total seconds for everything to complete
    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 5);
    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 30);

    // https only, please!
    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_PROTOCOLS, CURLPROTO_HTTPS);

    // ALWAYS verify SSL - this should NEVER be changed. 2 = strict verify
    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2);

    // return the result from the server as the return value of curl_exec instead of echoing it
    curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);

    if (strcasecmp($method, 'POST') === 0) {
        curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    } elseif (strcasecmp($method, 'GET') !== 0) {
        // perhaps a DELETE?
        curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST, strtoupper($method));
    }

    $pardotApiResponse = curl_exec($curl_handle);
    if ($pardotApiResponse === false) {
        // failure - a timeout or other problem. depending on how you want to handle failures,
        // you may want to modify this code. Some folks might throw an exception here. Some might
        // log the error. May you want to return a value that signifies an error. The choice is yours!

        // let's see what went wrong -- first look at curl
        $humanReadableError = curl_error($curl_handle);

        // you can also get the HTTP response code
        $httpResponseCode = curl_getinfo($curl_handle, CURLINFO_HTTP_CODE);

        // make sure to close your handle before you bug out!
        curl_close($curl_handle);

        throw new Exception("Unable to successfully complete Pardot API call to $url -- curl error: \"".
                                "$humanReadableError\", HTTP response code was: $httpResponseCode");
    }

    // make sure to close your handle before you bug out!
    curl_close($curl_handle);

    return $pardotApiResponse;
}

//this will log in and print your API Key (good for 1 hour) to the console
echo callPardotApi('https://pi.pardot.com/api/login/version/3',
    array(
        'email' => 'your.email@example.com',
        'password' => 'password1234',
        'user_key' => '12345678890abcdef12345678890abcdef' //available from https://pi.pardot.com/account
    )
);
```
