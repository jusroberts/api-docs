## [](#manipulating-the-result-set-)Manipulating the Result Set

Since `query` result sets are limited to 200 results each, the results returned may not include all prospects that were matched by the query. To retrieve the remaining results, the following criteria can be used to navigate through the result set.


| Parameter              | Datatype         | Options                                                                | Description |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `fields` | `array` | `<comma_separated_field_ids>` | Specifies the fields to be returned. **Note:** If this parameter isn't present, all default fields and custom fields for which the prospect has a value will be returned; &lt;id&gt; will always be returned. |
| `limit` | `integer` | `<any_positive_integer>` | Specifies the number of results to be returned. _Default value:_ `200`. **_Note:_** This number cannot be larger than 200. |
| `offset` | `integer` | `<any_positive_integer>` | Specifies the first matching prospect(according to the specified sorting order) to be returned in the query response. The first `offset` matching prospects will be omitted from the response. _Default value:_ `0`. **_Example:_** Specifying `offset=400` will return the results starting with the 401st prospect matched by the provided criteria. |
| `output` | `string` | `simple, mobile` | Specifies the format to be used when returning the results of the query. See [XML Response Formats](using-prospects#xml-response-formats) in [Using Prospects](using-prospects) for more details. |
| `sort_by` | `string` | `created_at, id, probability, value` | Specifies the field that should be used to sort the results of the query. See [Supported Sorting Options (#14784-supported-sorting-options) for more details. _Default value:_ `id`. |
| `sort_order` | `string` | `ascending, descending` | Specifies the ordering to be used when sorting the results of the query. The default value varies based on the value of the `sort_by` parameter. See [Supported Sorting Options](#supported-sorting-options) for more details. |

## [](#supported-sorting-options-)Supported Sorting Options

The ordering of the results returned by a `query` request can be changed by specifying `sort_by` and `sort_order` parameters. Any of the following values are valid when specifying the `sort_by` parameter. For a complete list of fields involved in Prospect queries, see [Prospect](object-field-references#prospect) in [Object Field References](object-field-references).

| **Value** | **Default Sort Order** | **Description** |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| `created_at` | `descending` | Specifies that the query results should be sorted by the prospects' `created_at` timestamps. |
| `id` | `ascending` | Specifies that the query results should be sorted by the prospects' `id` fields. |
| `last_activity_at` | `descending` | Specifies that the query results should be sorted by the prospects' `last_activity_at` timestamps. |
| `updated_at` | `descending` | Specifies that the query results should be sorted by the prospects' `updated_at` timestamps. |

<a name="14833-assigning-and-reassigning-prospects" id="assigning-and-reassigning-prospects"></a>

## [](#assigning-and-reassigning-prospects-)Assigning and Reassigning Prospects

To assign/reassign a prospect, both the prospect to be assigned and the target user or group of the assignment must be defined. Prospects can be specified by their Pardot ID or CRM FID. Users or groups can be specified by their Pardot user ID, email address, or Pardot group ID. Possible combinations of parameters are shown below. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by `<carets>`.

**_Examples:_**

/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?user_email=&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?user_id=&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

/api/prospect/version/3/do/assign/id/?group_id=&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

XML responses to `assign` requests are identical to `read` requests, but reflect the new prospect assignment in the `<assigned_to>` node.

<a name="14833-creating-prospects" id="creating-prospects"></a>

## [](#creating-prospects-)Creating Prospects

To create a prospect via the API, only a valid email address is required. Values for any other prospect fields may also be provided in the `create` request. Developers are responsible for substituting specific values for parameters denoted by `<carets>`.

_**Example:** Creating a new prospect_/api/prospect/version/3/do/create/email/[new_prospect@pardot.com](mailto:new_prospect@pardot.com)?first_name=New&amp;last_name=Prospect&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

XML responses to `create` requests are identical to `update` and `read` requests. If no `campaign_id` value is provided, the new prospect will be automatically assigned to the oldest existing campaign.

<a name="14833-updating-field-values" id="updating-field-values"></a>

## [](#enpoints-batch-processing-)Endpoints for Batch Processing

There are 3 endpoints available for batch processing up to 50 prospects at a time:

/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchCreate

/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpdate

/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpsert

These endpoints expect a query variable called "prospects" which holds either JSON or XML encoded data.

JSON Example:

```
{
    "prospects": {
        "1234": {
            "first_name": "New first name",
            "last_name": "New last name"
        },
        "1337": {
            "first_name": "New first name",
            "last_name": "New last name"
        },
        "9": {
            "first_name": "New first name",
            "last_name": "New last name"
        }
    }
}
```
XML Example:
```
<prospects>
    <prospect identifier="1234">
        <first_name>New first name</first_name>
        <last_name>New last name</last_name>
    </prospect>
    <prospect identifier="1337">
        <first_name>New first name</first_name>
        <last_name>New last name</last_name>
    </prospect>
    <prospect identifier="9">
        <first_name>New first name</first_name>
        <last_name>New last name</last_name>
    </prospect>
</prospects>
```

If using `batchCreate`, you'll need to provide a valid and unique email address for each prospect. The `batchUpdate`  endpoints allow the use of prospect IDs and `batchUpsert` allows the use of prospect IDs and prospect Email Addresses.

**_Example:_**

/api/prospect/version/3/do/batchUpdate?prospects={"prospects":{"1337":{"first_name":"New first name","last_name":"New last name"},"1234":{"first_name":"New first name","last_name":"New last name"}}}&api_key=&user_key=

**Note:** The return value will either be XML or JSON (XML by default. If you want JSON, then add "&format=json" to your HTTP query).


## [](#updating-field-values-)Updating Field Values

Modifying values of prospect data fields is done by submitting an `update` request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as `<field_name>=<value>`. Custom field values are updated using the same syntax.

_**Example:** Updating the phone number of a prospect whose Pardot ID is_ `300`: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/300?phone=888-123-4567&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

Only values that are specifically named in the request are updated. All others are left unchanged. To clear a value, submit an `update` request containing a parameter with no specified value, such as `phone=`.

**_Note:_** Any field that is set to record multiple responses cannot have its values cleared this way.

<a name="14833-updating-fields-with-predefined-values" id="updating-fields-with-predefined-values"></a>

## [](#updating-fields-with-predefined-values-)Updating Fields with Predefined Values

Modifying values of prospect data fields with predefined values is accomplished through an `update` request with parameters for each field to be updated. Each parameter is formatted as `<field_name>=<value>` where `<value>` matches the predefined field value. Custom field values are updated using the same syntax.

_**Example:** Updating the category of a prospect whose Pardot ID is_ `300` *to the category `consumer`: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/300?category=consumer&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

<a name="14833-updating-fields-with-multiple-values" id="updating-fields-with-multiple-values"></a>

## [](#updating-fields-with-multiple-values-)Updating Fields with Multiple Values

Updating field values with multiple values follows the same convention as fields with predefined values, but requires a different parameter naming scheme to allow multiplicity. An `update` request is submitted with parameters formatted as `<field_name>_<count>=<field_value>` where `<count>` is an integer denoting the current parameter's place in sequence. `<count>` must start at 0 and increase by 1 until all desired values are submitted.

_**Example:** Modifying the values of a custom field with field name_ `past_jobs` _for a prospect with a Pardot ID of_ `5`: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/5?past_jobs_0=janitor&amp;past_jobs_1=security&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

**Note:** Checkbox and multi-select fields are the only field types that can be updated in this manner. To clear all of the values for a checkbox or multi-select field, use `<field_name>_0=`. To clear specific values, just set the values that should remain in the prospect record using the method above.

<a name="14833-updating-email-list-subscriptions" id="updating-email-list-subscriptions"></a>

## [](#updating-email-list-subscriptions-)Updating Email List Subscriptions

To modify email list subscriptions for a prospect, the Pardot ID of the email list is required. Once the ID is obtained, an `update` is submitted with parameters formatted as `list_<list_id>=1` to create a subscription and `list_<list_id>=0` to end a subscription.

_**Example:** Adding a prospect whose Pardot ID is_ `300` _to an email list with Pardot ID_ `8`: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/300?list_8=1&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

Requests that attempt to subscribe a prospect to lists that it is already subscribed to are ignored. Unsubscribe requests are handled similarly.

To modify a prospect's matching status for associated profile criteria, the Pardot ID of the profile criteria is required. Once the ID is obtained, an `update` is submitted with parameters formatted as `profile_criteria_<profile_criteria_id>=<status>`. The value of `<status>` may be either `match`, `nomatch`, or `unknown`.

_**Example:** Setting a profile criteria for a prospect whose Pardot ID is_ `58` _to_ `match`: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/58?profile_criteria_8=match&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

_**Example:** Setting a profile criteria for a prospect with Pardot ID_ `58` _to_ `nomatch`: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/58?profile_criteria_8=nomatch&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

Only profile criteria that belong to the profile associated with the prospect can be updated using this method. Requests to update profile criteria not associated with the assigned profile will be ignored. Using any matching status values other than `match`, `nomatch`, or `unknown` will result in an error message. See [Error Codes &amp; Messages](error-codes-and-messages) for details.

## [](#updating-prospect-account-associations-)Updating Prospect Account Associations

To modify a prospect's matching status for associated prospect account, the Pardot ID of the prospect account is required. Once the ID is obtained, an `update` is submitted with parameters formatted as `prospect_account_id=<id>`.

_**Example:** Setting a prospect account for a prospect whose Pardot ID is_ `300` _to_ `match`: /api/prospect/version/3/do/update/id/300?prospect_account_id=&amp;api_key=&amp;user_key=

A prospect account with the id must exist, and can not be set if a CRM connector is set up in the account.
